    making such types like engine field with no generics solves lots of problems,

    all methods of a micro-service, you donâ€™t need to deal with generics when put 
    such instances into web server framework context and so on. When using generics, 
    sooner or later you are forced to deal with a kind of dynamic dispatching
     
    Database contains the state, event buffer, lock and the background worker fields
        - the engine itself
        - event buffer is the buffer of all current events 
        - lock is used when the engine is busy which is either the worker is working on buffer or there are unprocessed events inside it
        - background worker thread is used to execute tasks related to events constantly in the background, it can be tokio::spawn instead of storing a separate worker as feild
    typically any engine must contains a background worker thread to execute its task 
    in the background thread and a mutex or lock to lock the engine when its busy 
    working with executing tasks.
