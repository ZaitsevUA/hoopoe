## Execution flow & system design?

> [!TIP]
> any notification coming from different components or other service actor workers must be done accroding to the following steps:

- **step0)** a register notif api can be written to register either a producer or a consumer in the bakcground.

- **step1)** producer service actor sends `NotifData` to exchange.

- **step2)** consumer service actor receives `NotifData` from its queue bounded to the exchange.

- **step3)** instance of `NotifData` is cached on redis and stored in db.

- **step4)** client invokes `/notif/get/owner/` api to get its notification during the app execution in a short polling manner.

### proper way to write and handle async task execution! 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> every async task must be spawned in a free thread using a background worker which can be done via `tokio::spawn()`, it's like creating a worker per each async task.

```rust
async fn heavy_process(){
    // it can be one of the following tasks:
    // --> consuming task: send consume message to consumer actor
    // --> producing task: send produce message to producer actor
    // --> storing in db: send data to mutator actor 
    // --> storing in redis: cache on redis with exp key
    // --> locking logic 
}

let (tx, rx) = channel::<String>(); // channel for stringified data
let tx = tx.clone();
// spawn in the background and use channel to receive 
// data whenever the data is sent to the channel
tokio::spawn(async move{
    let res = heavy_process().await;
    tx.send(res).await;
});
while let Some(data) = rx.recv().await{
    // do the rest of the logics in here 
    // whenever we receive data
    // ...
}

// ------------
//      or 
// ------------

// spawn in the background but wait to gets solved 
// and once it's solved we then proceed with the rest
// of flow and cacnel other branches or async tasks
let task = tokio::spawn(async move{
    let res = heavy_process().await;
    tx.send(res).await;
});

tokio::select! {
    // choose this if it can gets completed soon
    _ = task => {
        // proceed with this flow
        // ...
    }, 
    // or if you think this gets completed soonly
    data = rx.recv() => {
        // proceed with this flow
        // ...
    }
}
```

## How 2 setup, develop, and deploy?

> [!NOTE]
> if you want to deploy as a publisher or producer service then get your hands dirty by developing the `apis/http`, `actors/producers`, as a subscriber or consumer however, develop the `apis/http`, `actors/consumers` folders.

### Dev env

```bash
# -----------------------
# ---- read/write access
sudo chown -R root:root . && sudo chmod -R 777 . 
```

#### step0) install necessary packages on Linux:

```bash
cd scripts && ./setup.sh
```

#### step1) create database 

> make sure you've created the database using:

```bash
sqlx database create
```

#### step2) create migration folder (make sure you have it already!)

> make sure you uncomment the runtime setup inside its `Cargo.toml` file.

```bash
sea-orm-cli migrate init -d migration
```
#### step3) create migration files

> make sure you've installed the `sea-orm-cli` then create migration file per each table operation, contains `Migrations` structure with `up` and `down` methods extended by the `MigrationTrait` interface, take not that you must create separate migration per each db operation when you're in production.

```bash
sea-orm-cli migrate generate "table_name"
```

#### step4) apply pending migrations (fresh, refresh, reset, up or down)

> once you've done with adding changes in your migration files just run the following to apply them in db.

```bash
# rollback all applied migrations, then reapply all migrations
sea-orm-cli migrate refresh # or up
```

#### step5) generate entity files for ORM operations

> generate Rust structures from your applied migrations inside the db for the `hoopoe` database in `entity/src` folder after that you can proceed with editing each eintity like adding hooks for different actions on an active model.

```bash
# generate entities for the database and all tables
sea-orm-cli generate entity -u postgres://postgres:geDteDd0Ltg2135FJYQ6rjNYHYkGQa70@localhost/hoopoe -o src/entities --with-serde both --serde-skip-deserializing-primary-key
# generate entity for an sepecific table only, eg: generating entity for hoops table
sea-orm-cli generate entity -t hoops -o src/entities --with-serde both --serde-skip-deserializing-primary-key
# don't skip deserializing primary key
sea-orm-cli generate entity -u postgres://postgres:geDteDd0Ltg2135FJYQ6rjNYHYkGQa70@localhost/hoopoe -o src/entities --with-serde both
```
#### step6) run server

> when you run server with `--fresh` command it'll fresh all migrations at startup (drop all tables from the database, then reapply all migrations) otherwise it'll only apply migrations (calling `up` method of all migration files).

```bash
# -------------------------------
# ------ hoopoe server --------
# -------------------------------
# launch as http with freshing db
cargo run --bin hoopoe -- --server http --fresh # default is http and fresh migrations
# or see help
cargo run --bin hoopoe -- --help
# ------------------------------
# ------ hooper servers --------
# ------------------------------
# launch as grpc with freshing db
cargo run --bin hooper -- --server grpc --fresh # default is grpc and fresh migrations
# launch as tcp with freshing db
cargo run --bin hooper -- --server tcp --fresh
# launch as p2p with freshing db
cargo run --bin hooper -- --server p2p --fresh
# or see help
cargo run --bin hooper -- --help
```

### 🚀 Prod env (the CI/CD approach):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> make sure you've opened all necessary domains inside your DNS panel per each nginx config file and changed the `hoopoe.app` to your own domain name in every where mostly the nginx config files and the `APP_NAME` in `consts.rs`. this approach can be used if you need a fully automatic deployment process, it uses github actions to build and publish all images on a self-hosted docker registry on a custom VPS, so update the github ci/cd workflow files inside `.github/workflows` folder to match your VPS infos eventually on every push the ci/cd process will begin to building and pushing automatically the docker images to the self-hosted registry. instead of using a custom registry you can use either ducker hub or github packages as well! it's notable that you should renew nginx service everytime you add a new domain or subdomain (do this on adding a new domain), `./renew.sh` script will create ssl certificates with certbot for your new domain and add it inside the `infra/docker/nginx` folder so nginx docker can copy them into its own container. for every new domain there must be its ssl certs and nginx config file inside that folder so make sure you've setup all your domains before pushing to the repo. continue reading... 

> you can build and up all images on your machine with `sudo docker compose up -d --build` command.

#### 🚨 me before you!

> [!CAUTION]
> make sure you've done following configurations properly before pushing to your repo:

- **step0)** create database with the same name inside the `.env` file on the VPS using command.

- **step1)** generate new ssl dh params for nginx using `openssl dhparam -out infra/docker/nginx/ssl-dhparams.pem 4096` command.

- **step2)** setup ssl certs using `renew.sh` script and nginx config files per each domain and subdomain then put them inside `infra/docker/nginx` folder, **you MUST do this before you get pushed to the repo on github** cause there is already an nginx container inside the `docker-compose.yml` needs its files to be there to move them into the container on every push! 

- **step3)** you would probably want to make `logs` dir and `docker.hoopoe.app` routes secure and safe, you can achieve this by adding an auth gaurd on the docker registry subdomain and the logs dir inside their nginx config files eventually setup the password for them by running `sudo apt-get install -y apache2-utils && htpasswd -c infra/docker/nginx/.htpasswd hoopoe` command, the current one is `hoopoe@1234`.

- **step4)** run `sudo rm .env && sudo mv .env.prod .env` then update necessary variables inside `.env` file.

- **step5)** connect your device to github for workflow actions using `gh auth login -s workflow`, this allows you to push to the repo.

- **step6)** setup `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_USER` and `SERVER_PASSWORD` secrets on your repository.

- **step7)** created a `/root/hoopoe` folder on your VPS containing the `docker-compose.yml` file only and update its path inside the `cicd.yml` file in ssh action part where you're changing directory to where the docker compose file is in.

- **step8)** make sure the docker [registry](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/) service is up and running on your VPS (run `sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always --name registry registry:2`) and you have an already setup the `docker.hoopoe.app` subdomain for that which is pointing to the `http://localhost:5000`. use this command to run a registry docker: `sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart always --name registry registry:2` then login to your hub with `sudo docker login docker.hoopoe.app` command.

- **step9)** each internal image name inside your compose file must be prefixed with your docker hub registry endpoint which currently the hub has setup to `docker.youwho.club` endpoint, doing so tells docker to pull images from there cause as we know this subdoamin is already pointing to the docker registry hosted on `localhost:5000` on VPS.

> **current hub registry is set to `docker.youwho.club` and the `/root/hoopoe` folder on the VPS would be the place where the `docker-compose.yml` file is in**

> make sure you've logged in with `sudo` cause `cicd.yml` is building, pushing and pulling images using `sudo docker ...` command.

#### ☕ What's happening inside the `cicd.yml` file?

- **step1)** it reads the codes inside the repository to find the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **step1)** tries to login (docker username and password) to your custom docker hub (the registry on your VPS secured with nginx auth gaurd).

- **step2)** builda all docker container images inside your `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **step3)** eventually it pushes them to your custom docker hub registry.

- **step4)** does ssh to the VPS and cd to where you've put the `docker-compose.yml` file in there then pull and up all pushed docker containers from the VPS hub inside the VPS.

#### last but not least!

use postman to check the server health and register notif producer and consumer.


### When developing?!

- always update:
    - cicd.yml `uses` section
    - erd pictures every time you are finished with developing database tables
    - crates and Rust edition!
    - postman collection
